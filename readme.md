## What Is RollWright?

Well, in simple terms, RollWright is a dice roller. In more precise language it's a random number generator that includes functionality for calculating mathematic expressions which include these randomly generated numbers.

The math is actually handled by a lovely little library called [MathJS](http://mathjs.org). RollWright just
1. takes user input
2. finds any dice roll requests in that input
3. performs the random number generation
4. then passes the calculated mathematical expression to **MathJS**.

It's really not too complicated.

Anyway this is mostly just a little project to help me fill out my portfolio with something pretty, functional, and that can help me roll damage for my level 17 Warblade (D`&`D 3.5 is pretty much ridiculous at high level). I've got some fun ideas to implement later on (saved custom rolls, visual themes, multi-user sessioning, better responsive design) but since I'm juggling the tail end of school and the job hunt, it's gonna take some time for that to come to fruition.
